# FrameLESS - Quick and Easy LESS Web Development Library
A quick and easy starting point for web development projects written with Less CSS. Lay out the structure of your pages and files in seconds.

FrameLESS includes some interesting libraries and pre-programmed styles that will speed up your web development workflow. The LESS files include some very easy to use mixins so you can make you code neater and adjust the common styles in under a minute.

You can use this to speed up any project for personal or commercial work. All I ask is you keep attribution information.
