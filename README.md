# FrameLESS - Quick and Easy LESS Web Development Library

FrameLESS includes some interesting libraries and pre-programmed styles that will speed up your web development workflow. The LESS files include some very easy to use mixins so you can make you code neater and adjust the common styles in under a minute.

You can use this to speed up any project for personal or commercial work. All I ask is you keep attribution information.
